# Ableton AHK

I've created this script to get more keyboard shortcuts in Ableton, adding features like:

- Automation making (from Ableton and 3rd party plugins)
- Opening browser, piano roll, groups of tracks, plugins and its windows

## Instalation

Download [here](https://github.com/fdebkowski/Ableton-AHK/releases/tag/1.0) .exe file and run

## Controls

\` & 1 - Automate third party plugin (Select plugin, click on "Configure" button, hover over parameter to automate and press hotkey)  
\` & a - Quick Show Piano Roll  (This hotkey works only if piano roll/clip view is minimised or maximised)
\` & z - Fast Open Groups (Hover over group and press hotkey to open)  
\` & 2 - Automate Ableton plugins (Hover over Ableton plugin parameter and press hotkey to automate it)  
\` & x - Quick show/hide all tracks  
\` & w - Quick Show browser  
\` & d - Show/Hide Plugin Windows  
Tab - Tab to Shift Tab for quick switching between piano roll/effects  

Automatic function: When cursor is moved to the left side browser automatically opens

If you want to change predefined shortcut keys or plugins, you can do it in any text editor. Key list for Autohotkey can be found [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/KeyList.htm)
