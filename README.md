# Ableton AHK

I've created this script to get more keyboard shortcuts in Ableton, adding features like:
- Automation making (from Ableton and 3rd party plugins)
- Opening browser, piano roll, groups of tracks, plugins and its windows

## Instalation

Install Autohotkey and run Main.ahk

If you want to change predefined shortcut keys or plugins, you can do it in any text editor. Key list for Autohotkey can be found [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/KeyList.htm/)

## Additional info

Feel free to send me pull requests :)
