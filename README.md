# Ableton AHK

I've created this script to get more keyboard shortcuts in Ableton, adding features like:
- Automation making (from Ableton and 3rd party plugins)
- Opening browser, piano roll, groups of tracks, plugins and its windows

## Instalation

Install Autohotkey and run Main.ahk

## Additional info

Feel free to send me pull requests :)
